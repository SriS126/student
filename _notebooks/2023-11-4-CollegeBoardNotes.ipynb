    "Basic Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode is written in plain English with a structured syntax.\n",
    "It often begins with declarations of variables and their types.\n",
    "Pseudocode includes common programming constructs like loops, conditionals, and procedures (functions).\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are declared with names and data types. For example, int count.\n",
    "You can initialize variables and assign values, such as count <- 0.\n",
    "Input and Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Common I/O commands include READ for input and PRINT for output.\n",
    "For example, READ number would read input into a variable named number.\n",
    "Conditional Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Common conditional statements include IF, ELSE IF, and ELSE.\n",
    "Use comparisons like =, <>, <, <=, >, >= to evaluate conditions.\n",
    "For ex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "IF age >= 18 THEN\n",
    "    PRINT \"You are an adult.\"\n",
    "ELSE\n",
    "    PRINT \"You are not an adult.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "Common loop constructs include FOR, WHILE, and DO UNTIL.\n",
    "A loop may have a condition, such as FOR i <- 1 TO 10.\n",
    "ex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "FOR i <- 1 TO 5\n",
    "    PRINT \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "END FOR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedures are used to group related code into reusable functions.\n",
    "You can define procedures with PROCEDURE and call them with CALL.\n",
    "ex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "PROCEDURE CalculateAverage\n",
    "    total <- 0\n",
    "    FOR i <- 1 TO 5\n",
    "        READ score\n",
    "        total <- total + score\n",
    "    END FOR\n",
    "    average <- total / 5\n",
    "    PRINT \"Average: \" + average\n",
    "END PROCEDURE\n",
    "\n",
    "CALL CalculateAverage\n",
    "```\n",
    "Arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode supports arrays, and you can declare them like ARRAY arr[1..10] OF INTEGER.\n",
    "Access elements with indices, such as arr[5].\n",
    "Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are important for explaining your code. Use # or REM to indicate comments.\n",
    "ex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This is a comment\n",
    "REM Another comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "Whitespace and Indentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "While not strictly enforced, proper indentation helps improve code readability and structure.\n",
    "Modularity and Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode encourages breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts using procedures.\n",
    "Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your pseudocode to ensure it functions as expected. Include various test cases.\n",
    "Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode can be optimized for efficiency and clarity. Consider the algorithm's runtime and memory usage.\n",
    "Practice and Familiarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Becoming proficient in writing and reading pseudocode comes with practice. Work on sample problems and exercises."
