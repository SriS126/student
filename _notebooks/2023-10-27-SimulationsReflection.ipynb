    "Simulations are a technique used to model real-world scenarios in a controlled environment. They are often used when conducting experiments in the real world is impractical, expensive, or even dangerous.\n",
    "Simulations attempt to mimic the behavior of a real system or object, providing insights into how they might perform under certain conditions without the need to use the actual system or object.\n",
    "While simulations aim to provide accurate results, they are not the same as direct experiments and may include certain abstractions and simplifications.\n",
    "Simulations can be advantageous in cases where real-world testing is not feasible or cost-effective.\n",
    "Simulations vs. Experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations are cost-effective as they don't require the use of real-world equipment and can be easily repeated with different scenarios.\n",
    "Experiments involve real-world objects and equipment, making them more expensive and potentially riskier.\n",
    "Simulations provide estimated results based on models, while experiments provide actual results.\n",
    "Simulations can model real-world events that may not be practical or safe for experiments, such as simulating the impact of a car crash.\n",
    "Simulations are often considered safer to conduct than real-world experiments.\n",
    "Random Number Generators:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations can introduce variability to mimic real-world randomness using random number generators. These generators provide a degree of unpredictability in the simulation's results, making them more realistic.\n",
    "Constraints in Using Computer Simulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer simulations are bound by certain constraints, including: They often make assumptions about the real-world object or system they model.\n",
    "The parameters and conditions of a simulation can be challenging to change, making adaptability a constraint.\n",
    "Computer simulations should be run on suitable hardware and software environments.\n",
