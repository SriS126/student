    "## Trimester 1 of AP CSP\n",
    "In the first tri, I accomplished a lot of work on the front end. I had a really fun time making simple games with Soham, and learned more about JS and its implementation. I first started coding some simple quizzes and simple games. After I looked at some other games' code such as Snake and Game of life, I coded a rectangle game with moving objects. I then learned more js from the teach teaches and finally started coding our passion project Phoenix. Pheonix was a twitter-clone and allowed users to post. I mainly worked on the user profile and frontend, using a little front end and a lot of backend to store the users in a database. It was fun working on front end and backend and learning more about databases.\n",

    "## Trimester 2 - Now\n",
    "At the beginning of the tri, my group and I worked on the binary project. Soham and I mainly focused on a binary to music program, where I played around with sound and code. I mainly worked on the frontend but helped code some of the buttons and binary conversion. Jonathan and Deva coded a video to binary conversion. I really liked this project as music is one of my hobbies, and I got to code with it. Our CPT project now is going to be a lot of programs, such as a painting program. I will be focusing on backend more now during this project.\n",
