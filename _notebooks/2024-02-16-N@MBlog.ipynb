    "- We showed all our features effectively and demonstrated our backend, login, and signup\n",
    "- The visitors played around with our image editor and painter, colored a lot of cats\n",
    "- We could explain our code pretty well and explained what an \"api\" is and what \"jwt\" is\n",
    "- We learned about others code too, we visited other people's projects after our shift\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grows\n",
    "- We could've let the people experiment on our code and run it locally\n",
    "- We should've went more in depth in our code, just gave a brief overview\n",
    "- We wanted to show the use of api's more as they still wanted to know how they work\n",
    "- We should've had a greater pitch or like enthusiasm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feedback\n",
    "- For my color painter, I should've added a feature where you can upload an image and color it, then save it\n",
    "- I want to add more features and make the eraser an individual icon\n",
    "- I would like to add the moving background of our homepage to my thing behind\n",
    "- I wanted to work on the backend a bit more, maybe even add a saved profile system that let's you see ur saved work\n",
