# Summary of JavaScript Concepts

- JavaScript can be included in HTML or Jupyter cells using `<script></script>` tags.
- The output of JavaScript code, such as `console.log` statements, can be viewed in the browser's console.
- Developers can activate the console through various methods depending on their environment (e.g., VSCode, browsers).

## Referencing HTML Elements Using JavaScript

- To access an HTML element, use `document.getElementById("idTag")`, where the ID corresponds to the HTML element's ID attribute.
- The retrieved HTML element is stored in a JavaScript variable, allowing developers to manipulate it.

## Getting Data Within HTML Elements

- To access the content within an HTML element, use the `.innerHTML` property of the JavaScript variable representing that element.
- This property allows developers to retrieve and display the content of an HTML element.

## Setting Data Within HTML Elements

- The `.innerHTML` property can be used to set the content of an HTML element, effectively changing its text or inner HTML.

## Creating HTML Elements Dynamically

- Developers can create new HTML elements using the `document.createElement` function, specifying the type of element to create.
- These dynamically created elements can be manipulated and added to the HTML page using JavaScript.

## Functions in JavaScript with DOM

- Functions in JavaScript allow developers to encapsulate code into reusable blocks, enhancing code organization and maintainability.
- Functions can accept parameters as input and return values as output.
- JavaScript functions can be used in conjunction with the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with HTML elements.

## OnClick Event

- The `onclick` event allows developers to specify a function to run when a particular HTML element (e.g., a button) is clicked.
- This event handler can be used to trigger actions based on user interactions.

# Summary of HTML Concepts

- HTML is a markup language used to structure the content of web pages.
- It uses tags to define elements, with opening and closing tags wrapping content (e.g., `<tagname>content</tagname>`).
- HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information and usually come in name/value pairs (e.g., `attribute_name="attribute_value"`).
- Common HTML tags include headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), and formatting tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`).
- HTML elements can be grouped together using the `<div>` tag.
- Developers can reference HTML elements in JavaScript using `document.getElementById("idTag")`.
- The `.innerHTML` property allows access to the content within an HTML element.
- JavaScript can dynamically create HTML elements and add them to the page.
- Functions in JavaScript can be used to encapsulate code for reuse.
- The `onclick` event allows developers to trigger functions when certain HTML elements are clicked.
